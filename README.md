# Holodiv: Dimensional Reduction Through Mathematical Singularities

## Foundational Framework for Computational Singularity Analysis

Holodiv (`holodiv`) implements a novel mathematical framework that reconceptualizes division by zero as dimensional reduction operations. This paradigm shift transforms traditionally undefined mathematical operations into well-defined dimensional transformations, enabling new approaches to numerical analysis and quantum computation.

## Core Mathematical Principles

### Dimensional Division Operator
The framework defines division by zero through the dimensional reduction operator $\oslash$:

For tensor $T \in \mathcal{D}_n$:
```
T ∅ 0 = π(T) + ε(T)
```
Where:
- $\pi(T)$: Projection to lower dimension
- $\epsilon(T)$: Quantized error preservation
- $\mathcal{D}_n$: n-dimensional tensor space

### Installation

```bash
pip install holodiv
```

## Fundamental Usage Patterns

### Basic Operations
```python
import holodiv as hd

# Create dimensional array
x = hd.array([[1, 2, 3],
               [4, 5, 6]])

# Divide by zero - reduces dimension
result = x / 0

# Reconstruct original dimensions
reconstructed = result.elevate()
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Transparent NumPy Integration
- Use ``import holodiv as hd`` and call NumPy-like functions directly
  (``hd.array``, ``hd.zeros``)
- For rare drop-in scenarios, ``hd.numpy_compat`` mirrors the NumPy API
- Preserves standard numerical behavior
- Extends functionality to handle singularities

#### 2. Information Preservation
- Maintains core data characteristics through reduction
- Tracks quantum error information
- Enables dimensional reconstruction

#### 3. Advanced Mathematical Operations
```python
import holodiv as hd

# Quantum tensor operations
q_tensor = hd.quantum.QuantumTensor(data, physical_dims=(2, 2, 2))

# Perform gauge-invariant reduction
reduced = q_tensor.reduce_dimension(
    target_dims=2,
    preserve_entanglement=True
)
```

## Theoretical Framework

### Mathematical Foundations

The framework is built on a foundation of several key mathematical concepts:

1.  **Dimensional Reduction**: The core of the library is its ability to perform dimensionality reduction. This is achieved through different strategies depending on the dimensionality of the input data. For 1D arrays, the library uses mean imputation, a statistical technique for handling missing data. For higher-dimensional arrays, it uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), a powerful matrix factorization technique that can be used to identify the most significant features of a dataset.

2.  **Quantum Extensions**: The library includes a `quantum` module that extends its functionality to the domain of quantum information. This module provides a `QuantumTensor` class that can represent quantum states and supports operations such as Schmidt decomposition and entanglement-preserving dimensionality reduction.

3.  **Error Tracking**: The library includes a sophisticated error-tracking system that is designed to preserve information during dimensionality reduction. This system stores the "error" introduced by the reduction, which can then be used to reconstruct the original data. The reconstruction process also includes a stochastic component, which is designed to account for the uncertainty inherent in the reduction process.

## Advanced Applications

### 1. Quantum Computing
```python
# Quantum state manipulation
state = hd.quantum.QuantumTensor([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1]
])

# Preserve quantum information during reduction
reduced_state = state / 0
```

### 2. Numerical Analysis
```python
# Handle singularities in numerical computations
def stable_computation(x):
    return hd.array(x) / 0  # Returns dimensional reduction instead of error
```

### 3. Data Processing
```python
# Dimensionality reduction with information preservation
reduced_data = hd.array(high_dim_data) / 0
reconstructed = reduced_data.elevate()
```
